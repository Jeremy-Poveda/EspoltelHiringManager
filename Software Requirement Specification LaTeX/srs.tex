\chapter{Introduction}
Throughout this document, we will detail the product designed to meet ESPOLTEL's needs. ESPOLTEL is a company dedicated to innovative project management, focused on the advancement of technological development in Ecuador. In order to improve efficiency in the creation and initial management flows of projects, Espoltel Hiring Manager aims to meet all the requirements that current tools may not fully comply with.\\
During this process, the \hyperlink{moscow}{MoSCoW} methodology was applied to manage the development iteratively, with functional requirements structured as user stories. Functional requirements were prioritized using the \hyperlink{scrum}{SCRUM} method to clearly define their importance, and non-functional requirements were organized by the \hyperlink{sommerville}{Sommerville} classification.

\section{Client}
Francisco Ramirez is one of the lead systems analyst on ESPOLTEL, he is the main client in responsible for the project's completion. ESPOLTEL S.A. is a company dedicated to innovation in \hyperlink{it}{IT} project management and consulting, which is why we handle multiple clients from different disciplines that are looking for technological solutions in Ecuador.

 
\section{Purpose}
The system aims to optimize and automate ESPOLTEL's recruitment and project management processes, serving both internal stakeholders, such as project managers, managers, human talent, human resources staff and aspirants. Project managers have to send recruitment requests, specifying aspirant profiles and job requirements, while the human talent department can oversee document requests to aspirants, human resources has to manage the creation of contracts and verify electronic signatures. In addition, aspirants need to track the progress of their application, while managers need to simultaneously review and securely sign multiple documents electronically. For improve interaction efficiency, reduce processing times, and support secure document handling throughout ESPOLTEL. This system is necessary because the software tools they currently use are too basic and their signer only allows them to sign one document at a time, making it ineffective.

\section{Product Perspective}

ESPOLTEL manages the talent management process, handling multiple projects simultaneously and collaborating with various stakeholders. Currently, it relies on technologies that assist in this mission; however, these tools fail to meet all its requirements. Thus, the objective of this product is to implement the signing of multiple contracts digitally for project managers, achieving an automated talent management process through a centralized web platform that incorporates the process flow for various stakeholders:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Managers}: Responsible for creating hiring needs and seeking to hire a group of people that meet a specified role and profiles to fulfill those needs.
    \item \textbf{Project Aspirants}: Individuals interested in applying for vacancies at ESPOLTEL projects.
    \item \textbf{Human Resources Department}: Responsible for requesting documents and information from aspirants according to the required profile, create documents such as contracts and confidentiality agreements, validating profile qualifications, and verifying electronic signatures. This role ensures that the paperwork in the hiring process will complete with success in each stage.
    \item \textbf{Managers}: Responsible for making final hiring decisions regarding aspirants.
\end{itemize}

In addition, a mobile application will be included with a contract tracking panel, allowing directors and managers to view the current status of pending contracts requiring signatures. Another functionality available to aspirants is the notification of acceptance into the application process, followed by the respective signing of contracts and/or confidentiality agreements.

\subsection*{Template Questions for the Interview}

1. Are "Human Talent" and "Human Resources" distinct roles within the company?

    If yes, is the Human Resources area responsible for generating documents such as contracts and confidentiality agreements?\\

    What we understand is as follows:\\
    Human Talent:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Requests documents and information from applicants.
        \item Verifies that applicants meet the position requirements.
        \item Sends the data of candidates who meet the requirements to Human Resources.
    \end{itemize}
    Human Resources:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generates documents such as contracts and confidentiality agreements.
        \item Sends the generated contracts or agreements to the applicant.
        \item Verifies the applicant's signature.
        \item Sends the documents to managers for their signatures.
    \end{itemize}

2. Must the contracts and confidentiality agreements be signed not only by the managers and applicants but also by the project director?\\

3. In addition to requesting basic information such as names, surnames, cell phone numbers, etc., should the Human Talent area request specific documents according to the profile, such as copies of the ID, voting card, etc.?\\

4. Who is responsible for entering the templates of the contracts or confidentiality agreements into the system: Human Talent or Human Resources?\\

5. Should these templates be created directly within the system? If yes, would the data be in plain text, such as names, surnames, ID numbers, and the positions for electronic signatures (of managers, applicants, and possibly project directors)?\\

6. Would the stages of the applicant acceptance process be as follows?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application for a profile by submitting information (plain text data and documents).
    Waiting for a response from Human Talent to verify if the applicant meets the requirements.
    If the applicant meets the requirements, waiting for the contract and confidentiality agreements to sign, generated by Human Resources.
    \item Signing the documents.
    \item  Waiting for signature validation by Human Resources.
    \item  Waiting for signatures from managers and directors.
    \item Confirmation of participation in the project.
\end{itemize}
