\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Summary}
This document presents a comprehensive framework for the design, planning, and execution of the ESPOLTEL HIRING MANAGER system. This product integrates a robust risk management strategy, a detailed project execution timeline, and a structured Sprint Backlog plan. Through the inclusion of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, we provide a thorough representation of both the static and behavioral logic of the system, ensuring that the architecture adheres to SOLID principles and eliminates implementation inefficiencies.

Our primary objective is to meticulously define the planning and breakdown of the system’s static structure, logical flow, behavioral processes, implementation strategies, and activity sequences. These components collectively support the realization of a user-centric, scalable, and maintainable product.

\section{Key features and Objetives}
The ESPOLTEL HIRING MANAGER product is designed to streamline and enhance the recruitment process, leveraging a combination of web and mobile modules for maximum efficiency. Key objectives include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Risk Mitigation:} Developing a proactive risk management plan to address potential challenges in implementation and deployment.
	\item \textbf{Comprehensive Planning:} Structuring the project execution into manageable phases using Agile methodologies.
	\item \textbf{System Design:} Crafting static and behavioral UML diagrams to visualize the architecture, interactions, and workflows.
	\item \textbf{Adherence to SOLID Principles:} Ensuring maintainability and scalability by avoiding anti-patterns and promoting clean code practices.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Risk management}
In this section, we will identify, quantify, and classify the various risks that may arise during the software development process. Additionally, we will provide a detailed assessment of the likelihood of occurrence, the potential impact of each risk, and the corresponding protocols to be followed in the event they materialize.

\subsection*{Template Questions for the Interview}

1. Are "Human Talent" and "Human Resources" distinct roles within the company?

    If yes, is the Human Resources area responsible for generating documents such as contracts and confidentiality agreements?\\

    What we understand is as follows:\\
    Human Talent:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Requests documents and information from aspirants.
        \item Verifies that aspirants meet the position requirements.
        \item Sends the data of candidates who meet the requirements to Human Resources.
    \end{itemize}
    Human Resources:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generates documents such as contracts and confidentiality agreements.
        \item Sends the generated contracts or agreements to the applicant.
        \item Verifies the applicant's signature.
        \item Sends the documents to managers for their signatures.
    \end{itemize}

2. Must the contracts and confidentiality agreements be signed not only by the managers and aspirants but also by the project director?\\

3. In addition to requesting basic information such as names, surnames, cell phone numbers, etc., should the Human Talent area request specific documents according to the profile, such as copies of the ID, voting card, etc.?\\

4. Who is responsible for entering the templates of the contracts or confidentiality agreements into the system: Human Talent or Human Resources?\\

5. Should these templates be created directly within the system? If yes, would the data be in plain text, such as names, surnames, ID numbers, and the positions for electronic signatures (of managers, aspirants, and possibly project directors)?\\

6. Would the stages of the applicant acceptance process be as follows?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application for a profile by submitting information (plain text data and documents).
    Waiting for a response from Human Talent to verify if the applicant meets the requirements.
    If the applicant meets the requirements, waiting for the contract and confidentiality agreements to sign, generated by Human Resources.
    \item Signing the documents.
    \item  Waiting for signature validation by Human Resources.
    \item  Waiting for signatures from managers and directors.
    \item Confirmation of participation in the project.
\end{itemize}
