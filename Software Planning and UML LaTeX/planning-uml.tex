\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Summary}
This document presents a comprehensive framework for the design, planning, and execution of the ESPOLTEL HIRING MANAGER system. This product integrates a robust risk management strategy, a detailed project execution timeline, and a structured Sprint Backlog plan. Through the inclusion of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, we provide a thorough representation of both the static and behavioral logic of the system, ensuring that the architecture adheres to SOLID principles and eliminates implementation inefficiencies.

Our primary objective is to meticulously define the planning and breakdown of the system’s static structure, logical flow, behavioral processes, implementation strategies, and activity sequences. These components collectively support the realization of a user-centric, scalable, and maintainable product.

\section{Key features and Objetives}
The ESPOLTEL HIRING MANAGER product is designed to streamline and enhance the recruitment process, leveraging a combination of web and mobile modules for maximum efficiency. Key objectives include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Risk Mitigation:} Developing a proactive risk management plan to address potential challenges in implementation and deployment.
	\item \textbf{Comprehensive Planning:} Structuring the project execution into manageable phases using Agile methodologies.
	\item \textbf{System Design:} Crafting static and behavioral UML diagrams to visualize the architecture, interactions, and workflows.
	\item \textbf{Adherence to SOLID Principles:} Ensuring maintainability and scalability by avoiding anti-patterns and promoting clean code practices.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Risk management}
In this section, we will identify, quantify, and classify the various risks that may arise during the software development process. Additionally, we will provide a detailed assessment of the likelihood of occurrence, the potential impact of each risk, and the corresponding protocols to be followed in the event they materialize.
